# WolfHUD

This was originally a recreated and updated version of GageHUD, since it was really painful to maintain with all the mixxed up files.

###Installation:
Simply drag and drop the Contents of the downloaded archive into your mods-folder, and you are good to go.
Configurations can be made through the included ingame menu.

__If you encounter any bugs, feel free to post about it on the issues tab! 
Please try to provide information from your crashlog/dump or anything useful, to understand what happened wrong.  ;)__
