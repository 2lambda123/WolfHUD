# WolfHUD
This is a Mod collection of several useful HUD altering mods.  
I've modified them and added feaatures, I felt were needed or useful.  
It was originally a recreated and updated version of GageHUD, since it was really painful to maintain with all the mixxed up files.

###Installation:
Simply drag and drop the Contents of the downloaded archive into your mods-folder, and you are good to go.  
Configurations can be made through the included ingame menu.  
__(You need the [BLT Hook](http://paydaymods.com/download/) for this mod to work)__  

###Bug reports:
__If you encounter any bugs, feel free to post about it on the issues tab!

to understand what happened wrong.  ;)__
